# JSON-As-Table Viewer
Jason-As-Table viewer is a simple Chrome Extension that displays JSON data as a table. 

The JSON data is converted to table format using following rules:
* If JSON data is directly an array, then each item of that array is shown as a row in the table.
* If JSON data is an object, then the items with in the first array field are shown as table rows.
* If JSON does not contain any array field, then JSON data is not converted.
